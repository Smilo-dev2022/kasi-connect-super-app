# UX Flow — CPF Safety Rooms

Purpose:
- Dedicated moderated spaces for safety alerts and coordination within a ward.

Scenarios:
- Resident joins CPF room to receive alerts
- CPF admin posts verified alert with location
- Residents can mark themselves safe or request help

Flow steps:
1) Discover Safety rooms from dashboard tile
2) Room list → CPF room (verified badge)
3) Room view → pinned safety guidelines, alerts feed
4) Post alert (admins) → type, description, location, media
5) Resident actions → Mark safe, Request help, Share location

Moderation and safeguards:
- Only verified CPF admins can post alerts
- Rate-limit broadcast alerts
- Quick escalation to emergency contacts
